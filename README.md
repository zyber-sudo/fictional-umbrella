P.S. The accompining documentation (Project Overview) is rather long, but breaks down things like the choice of algorithms and big-o analysis for the project. (see [Supporting Documents](https://github.com/zyber-sudo/fictional-umbrella#supporting-documents)) 

## Competencies:
These are the competencies the student needs to have to create the project and pass the class.

**4048.5.1 : Non-Linear Data**

  - The graduate creates software applications that incorporate non-linear data structures for efficient and maintainable software.

**4048.5.2 : Hashing Algorithms and Structures**

  - The graduate writes code using hashing techniques within an application to perform searching operations.

**4048.5.3 : Dictionaries and Sets**

  - The graduate incorporates dictionaries and sets in order to organize data into key-value pairs.

**4048.5.4 : Self-Adjusting Data Structures**

  - The graduate evaluates the space and time complexity of self-adjusting data structures using big-O notation to improve the performance of applications.

**4048.5.5 : Self-Adjusting Heuristics**

  - The graduate writes code using self-adjusting heuristics to improve the performance of applications.

**4048.5.6 : NP-Completeness and Turing Machines**

  - The graduate evaluates computational complexity theories in order to apply models to specific scenarios.
  
 ## Scenario
 The Western Governors University Parcel Service (WGUPS) needs to determine an efficient route and delivery distribution for their Daily Local Deliveries (DLD) because packages are not currently being consistently delivered by their promised deadline. The Salt Lake City DLD route has three trucks, two drivers, and an average of 40 packages to deliver each day. Each package has specific criteria and delivery requirements.

Your task is to determine an algorithm, write code, and present a solution where all 40 packages (listed in the attached “WGUPS Package File”) will be delivered on time while meeting each package’s requirements and keeping the combined total distance traveled under 140 miles for both trucks. The specific delivery locations are shown on the attached “Salt Lake City Downtown Map,” and distances to each location are given in the attached “WGUPS Distance Table.” The intent is to use the program for this specific location and also for many other cities in each state where WGU has a presence. As such, you will need to include detailed comments to make your code easy to follow and to justify the decisions you made while writing your scripts.

Keep in mind that the supervisor should be able to see, at assigned points, the progress of each truck and its packages by any of the variables listed in the “WGUPS Package File,” including what has been delivered and at what time the delivery occurred.
